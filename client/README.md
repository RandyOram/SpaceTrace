## Space Trace

Space Trace is a web application that simply tracks the ISS and displays it's location in real-time.

### About This Project

I'm developing this as an introduction to web development. I've always wondered if I've seen the ISS flying overhead before - so I figured this would be a fun way to find out. 

I have chosen to use React for the front-end and am trying to fully develop the interface before diving into the back-end.
