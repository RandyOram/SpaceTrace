## Space Trace

Space Trace tracks the international space station as it flies around the world! Its location is tracked in real-time and displayed on a map. Users will be able to create a simple account and provide their location and phone number to receive texts when the ISS is about to fly over their region!

### Why this project?

I recently visited Big Bend National Park in Texas and was in awe over how dark the sky was - I'd never seen anything quite like it. I could see more stars in one night than I'd ever seen before. There were also very few planes out there (it's truly in the middle of nowhere!), so when I saw something plane-like flying through the sky one night, I wondered if it was the ISS.

I couldn't figure it out then due to a lack of internet connection, so I had the thought that I'd create an app that alerts me via SMS whenever the ISS is about to fly overhead!

In terms of my technical aspirations, I decided to pursue Space Trace out of a desire to learn web development and hone my software engineering skills.

### Technologies leveraged (so far)

- React

React seemed like the go-to front-end framework to learn right now. I'm finding it very intuitive to create responsive front-ends. I particularly love the conditional rendering that React offers.

- Bootstrap

CSS has always been a pain for me (look at randyoram.com for an example of my first web development project - vanilla HTML and JS). I found positioning things to be very painful and all around discouraging. I made it a point in this project to learn how to use Bootstrap's grid system - and I've learned it well!

- Firebase

I chose to use Firebase for my back-end and hosting. I'm still in the process of setting this up.

### Things I've learned

- I really developed this out of order. I wish I had set up a proper CICD pipeline, hosting with Firebase, etc. I did this once my interface was almost finished. I think a lot of the reason for this mistake is that I just wanted to jump in and start developing - but I realize now that a little time up front would have saved me from a lot of time later.
